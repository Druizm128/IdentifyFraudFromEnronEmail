<b>The project uses financial and email data of top executives of Enron company with the purpose of training and tuning a machine learning algorithm that can predict which employees are "Persons of Interest"</b>. The Persons of Interest are defined as those top executives in the Enron Scandal that were indicted, reached a settlement or plea deal with the government of the United States, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.

Also the analysis was conducted using <b>Python</b> and in particular the following libraries were used: <b><i>Sklearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and SciPy</i></b>.

The data analysis is presented in a <b>Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)</b>.

This is the final project for Introduction to Machine Learning (Udacity.com Data Analyst NanoDegree)
